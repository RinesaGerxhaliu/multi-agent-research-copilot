# Data Directory – Healthcare Governance Knowledge Base

This folder contains the structured healthcare enterprise documentation used by the Multi-Agent Governance & Risk Intelligence Engine.

The documents simulate a regulated clinical analytics environment and support:

- Healthcare release governance validation
- Clinical risk register analysis
- Infrastructure readiness checks
- Capacity and workload validation
- Performance & availability monitoring
- Compliance-oriented decision support

This directory represents the **authoritative clinical knowledge boundary** for the system.

---

## Domain Context

The indexed documents model a Healthcare / Clinical Dashboard program operating under:

- Fixed production milestones (e.g., Week 16 release)
- Migration & security remediation streams
- Performance validation requirements
- Rollback preparedness policies
- Capacity allocation constraints
- Governance and escalation rules

The system is designed to simulate enterprise-grade release readiness validation in a healthcare setting where:

- Compliance is mandatory
- Milestones cannot shift without escalation
- Security clearance is required before production
- Performance targets must be validated
- No undocumented assumptions are allowed

##  `sample_docs/` – Healthcare Enterprise Documentation

This folder contains structured markdown documents representing a simulated healthcare enterprise program.

### Risk Register

Includes documented risks such as:

- Migration delay risks  
- Security approval delay risks  
- Performance optimization gaps  
- Infrastructure validation risks  
- Release readiness risks  

Each documented risk typically includes:

- Risk ID  
- Owner  
- Mitigation Target  
- Impact Level  

---

### Governance & Compliance Rules

Documents formal governance controls, including:

- Week 16 milestone immutability  
- Escalation conditions  
- Mandatory security review before production  
- No scope expansion permitted  
- Capacity validation requirements  
- Rollback preparedness obligations  

---

### Engineering Capacity Allocation

Covers resource planning and workload management:

- Migration stream  
- Security remediation stream  
- Analytics validation stream  
- Resource contention risks  
- Weekly review cadence  

---

### Performance & Availability Targets

Defines measurable operational targets:

- 99.9% uptime target  
- Monitoring configuration status  
- Average response time (< 350ms)  
- Internal load testing validation  
- Performance readiness requirements  

---

## `index/` – Vector Index

This folder contains the FAISS vector index and metadata used for semantic retrieval.

It includes:

- Embedded document chunks  
- Similarity scores  
- Document names  
- Chunk identifiers  

Any modification to `sample_docs/` requires re-indexing before the system can retrieve updated content.

---

## Retrieval & Evidence Policy

The system:

- Uses OpenAI embeddings (`text-embedding-3-small`)
- Retrieves top-k relevant document chunks
- Extracts evidence at chunk level
- Calculates confidence scores
- Validates citation structure
- Blocks unsupported claims

The system operates under a strict evidence policy:

> If information is not explicitly documented, it must return  
> **"Not found in sources."**

No inference.  
No hallucination.  
No undocumented assumptions.

---

## Prompt Injection Protection

The system includes detection mechanisms for:

- Instruction override attempts  
- Governance bypass attempts  
- Milestone manipulation requests  
- Mitigation target modification attempts  

If detected:

- Execution is blocked  
- The trace log records the incident  
- The system returns a controlled "Not found in sources." response  

---

## Evaluation Alignment

The evaluation test suite validates that the system:

- Correctly extracts documented risks  
- Identifies mitigation targets and owners  
- Verifies governance rules  
- Extracts performance targets  
- Identifies capacity constraints  
- Blocks prompt injection attacks  
- Returns "Not found in sources" when evidence is missing  

---

## Purpose of This Directory

This directory represents a simulated healthcare enterprise governance dataset used to demonstrate:

- Multi-agent structured analysis  
- Risk intelligence automation  
- Compliance validation workflows  
- Evidence-grounded AI reasoning  
- Secure release readiness evaluation  

All outputs generated by the system must be grounded strictly within these documents.
