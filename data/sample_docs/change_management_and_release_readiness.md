## Evidence Assessment

At the time of review:
- No change request records were found
- No release notes or stakeholder communications were provided
- No deployment readiness or rollback documentation was attached

As a result, all change management and release readiness claims in this document
are **not supported by verifiable source documents**.

## Verification Notes
Any system output referencing change approvals, release readiness, or rollback
preparedness must be flagged as:

**“Not found in sources.”**

Additional documentation required:
- Approved change request records
- Release notes and communication logs
- Deployment and rollback validation reports
