## 6. Required Output Structure

The system must produce a **decision-ready executive deliverable** that includes:

### 1. Executive Summary (≤150 words)
Clear overview of key findings and recommended priorities.

### 2. Client-Ready Email
Professional summary suitable for engineering leadership.

### 3. Action List Table
Each action must include:
- Action Description
- Owner
